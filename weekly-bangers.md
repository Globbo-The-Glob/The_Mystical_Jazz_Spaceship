*OF COURSE* The Mystical Jazz Spaceship broadcasts music baby, we wouldn't be the Anti-De Sitter Space's number one music station 5 eons running without it. Those cats love to boogie. 
Here are weekly bangers blogged hopefully weekly. The concept of a week gets a little fuzzy universe hopping, so let's see how we do.

WEEK 1 - 16/09/24

This cool happening comes straight from way back when because I recently rediscovered this track. It's one diddy collection of an ominous tunes, and the lyrics pull a sense of mystical dread out of me. Couple that with some slimey doom riffs and that's a winner. *Wizard's Hat* is definately a highlight, the "crazy alien goat dude with mad knife skills" sounds a hoot, might have to try get an interview sometime...

WEEK 2 - 07/11/24

I said a week isn't a week out here, yeesh. Anyways, this weeks offering is Russian artist Лиза Громова (Liza Gromova). The song is a beautiful showcase of the Russian language, projected over melancoly post punk sounds that create a hazy and rain-on-windows-but-we're-warm atmosphere. Her intonations and melody are unlike anything I've heard before. Enjoy, connect, here more.
