### Overview
I'm Harri (They/Them). 

Currently, I am finishing off a PhD at The University of Manchester in Soft Robotics. Hopefully some of that work will be hosted here.


Besides that, I am a mathematician, working on computational modelling with dynamic oscillator networks. I'm going to be getting more into this in the next few years, so I will kepp this website as a host for that work. 

Education content will be here, as well as my tutoring work. 

I'm also going to use this space to host projects, art and other things as time goes on, hoepfully it will fill up nicely.
