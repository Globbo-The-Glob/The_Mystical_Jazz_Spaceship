> If untold Buddha-lands are reduced to atoms, In one atom are untold lands, and as in one, so in each. The atoms to which these Buddha-lands are reduced in an instant are unspeakable,

Indra Theory is my pet name for a mathematical physics project I have been working on for a while. 
The essential idea comes from the idea that a systems ability to measure and act on the world is defined by interactions with an environment, where the system and environment have essentially the same dynamics. 
In this way, the essential difference between a system and environemnet is more arbituary. 
Currently, the project has many potential avenues, some more potent than others. Naturally, the manifestation of this idea evolves as I do, learning more and more. 
The basic underpinning of this project is the concept of synchrony. I think sync is a emergent property of a deeper underlying evolution in a system. 
This evolution takes many forms, some of which I suspect are isomorphic. 

Here I will have a few different types of articles: 
- Firstly, work logs, which report my progress as it goes and will likely contain mistakes and such. 
- Then, I will have more raw and wild thinking, usually developed as I read. The hosting of this type of work is part of my values with science, that it is an imperfect and explorative process. If by some miracle this is being read by anyone, and you know more, please contact me and lets talk.
- Finally, I will host what I believe to be highly polished work, akin to academic papers. Hopefully some of this will get published as I make progress, but we will have to see.
