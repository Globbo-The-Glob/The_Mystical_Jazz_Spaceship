Welcome, new traveller to my mystical jazz spaceship. We thank you for tuning in. This is the personal website of one Harri McAleese (They/Them - If you please x).

 This website will host all info about:
 - <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/about/">Me</a>  - Harri McAleese
 - <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/projects/">Projects</a> I'm working on.
 - An accesible <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/blog/">Blog</a> on maths and physics.
 - Information on my <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/tutoring/">Tutoring</a>.
 - <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/recent-mysticisms/">Essays</a>  on various topics.
 - My <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/cv/">CV</a>.

Please, explore the website. I hope something interests you. Right now it's a little sparse (as of Sep 2024), but I will be using it a lot more in the future. Right now, I'm <a href="/The_Mystical_Jazz_Spaceship/projects/building-the-site">building the site</a>, which you can check out at the link when I've written that up. 

That being said, I'm also writing up my thesis, so thats a time sink, and there may be periods where out frequency produces static for abit. That being said, callers for tutoring are always welcome.
