title: Building The Mystical Jazz Spaceship

The main idea behind building a website has been with me for some time. 

I am really not a fan of social media. I think it's bad for the soul and frankly a dangerous time sink. Not everyone shares my sentiment, but I can't really shake it. 
I've always been struck by the personality of sites that kind of move away from the standard social media local area, strike out on their own and make something new. 
I remember my youth looking at all the weird forums and strange personal sites I could find and enjoying the ride, the little gifs, quirks and easter eggs hidden about. It was characterful.
The internet is such a powerful tool, but those old days feel gone, and the interenet a little stangnant. There are naturally behemoths, incredibly useful places like wikipedia, youtube and, reluctantly, reddit, where hobbyists and enthusiasts can find useful info by the bucketful, but there is no where I wanted to set myself up. 

Recently, 3blue1brown published the results for the summer of math 3, a competition I have always wanted to enter, but haven't yet found the time. One of these was Juliapoo's fantastic entry <a href="https://juliapoo.github.io/mathematics/2023/07/15/plotting-cayley-graphs.html">Cayley Graphs and Pretty Things</a> which is a joyous read. What struck me though was the chracter oozing from every pore of their site. I was inspired. 
Naturally there are elements of their site in mine, because it struck me as my vibe. I'll post some other inspiring sites down below too. 

What I hope to do with the Mystical Jazz Spaceship is use this as a platform for all the work I do and want to do in the future, hosting it here for those that find it. I realise that I'd have more luck getting it seen on instagram, but I can't put Lorentz attractors in the background or make neon signs on instagram. 

Naturally, this site is fairly primative, and I use a lot of code I found online. Partly becasue I am new to this but partly because I don't have the time to commit fully to web dev. I hope it's fun to use and an interesting read on how I develop this.
